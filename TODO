I wanna create a project management web application using PHP, mySQL and OOP concepts like inheritance and polymorphysme,
The Webflow is the folowing:
    Index page -> Login or register
    if registered -> Show dashboard corresponding the the role_global of the user (normal, admin)
    for a normal user:
        show all the projects where the user is member of.
        this same user can be a project responsable or member.
        Every user can create new projects and add members to it.
        Every project member can read, add or modify the status or priority of any task of the project.
            for the responsible:
                the responsible has all the control over his project such as removing tasks or members and modifying projects informations.
                a full report of the project is displayed for the responsible.
    for an admin user:
        Show all the projects.
        can edit anything
        can get a report of every project.
    
additionnal features:
    search projects/tasks by keyword
    notifications for each even such as (new tasks, task status modification ...)
